# Unreleased

**Added:**
 - react-native-bpk-component-badge:
     - Badges now accept an optional `accessoryView` that allows icons, or other content, to be placed alongside the text inside the badge. See https://backpack.github.io/components/badge/?platform=native#with-icons
     - We've also added a `BpkBadgeIcons` component which provides an easy way to configure icons to display within the `accessoryView`.
