## Layout Grid Margins

These tokens should be used as an empty space to the left-and-right of the screen.
Nothing goes in this area, it acts as intentional white space so text doesn't touch the edge of a display.
This typically increases as screen sizes become larger.

<Tokens
  tokens={WEB_TOKENS}
  platform="web"
  matcher={({ category, name }) => category === 'breakpoints' && name.includes('MARGIN') }
/>
